AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS) is a fully managed service for running fault injection experiments to improve an applicationâ€™s performance,
observability, and resiliency.

This repo will create the FIS experiment template for MQTT failover and network disruption.
Resources
  IAM Role - Role created to perform the necessary action on the resources
  IAM Policy
    - Created to update the Log group
    - Created to perform the termination of ec2 instances
    - Created to perform the network disruption 
  Log Group - It will store the FIS log events

MQTT Expirement Template will create the FIS resource(mqtt-experiment_template) to perform the termination of ec2 instances
Network Disruption Experiment Template(network-experiment_template) will perform below two actions
  - It wil terminate the ec2 instances in a given subnet
  - It will block the network traffic for the subnet of MQTT 

Modules created for the reusability of the terraform scipts
  - modules/cloudwatch_log_group - Resource to create the fis-loggroup
  - modules/created_iam - IAM role and Policy can be provisioned using the modules
  - modules/fis_mqtt_failover - It will provision the experiment template only for the ec2 instances termination
  - modules/network_disruption - It will create the experiment template which will perform two actions (ec2-temrinate instances and disrupt network traffic)

Terraform script
  - main.tf : It will fetch the variables from the template.tfvars and invoke the resources defined in the modules 
  - template.tfvars : User will pass all the required variables to provision the experiment template
  - data.tf : It will fetch the attribute of the provisioned resources in AWS
  - output.tf : It will show the output of the provisioned resources
  
  
Commands to run the terraform script
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file="template.tfvars"
terraform apply -var-file="template.tfvars"
